# Component Documentation: Google Gemini API Integration

This document outlines the purpose, security considerations, and operational guidelines for the integration with the Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image API. All practices must align with the master security policy in `CONDUCTOR.md`.

## 1. Overview

*   **Purpose**: The Google Gemini API is used for AI-powered image generation and editing, which is the core function of the GemFlash application.
*   **Owner**: `@team-backend`
*   **Contact**: `backend-support@example.com`

## 2. Data Flow and Handling

The service interacts with the GemFlash backend exclusively. No direct client-side interaction occurs.

1.  **Request**: The GemFlash backend sends a request containing a user prompt and/or source images to the Google Gemini API endpoint.
2.  **Processing**: The Google Gemini service processes the data.
3.  **Response**: The Google Gemini service returns a generated or edited image to the GemFlash backend.

| Data Classification | Transmitted to Google? | Storage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User-Uploaded Images** | Yes | Processed ephemerally; subject to Google's data usage policies. |
| **AI Image Prompts** | Yes | Processed ephemerally; subject to Google's data usage policies. |

## 3. Security Controls

*   **Authentication**: API requests to the Google Gemini service are authenticated using an API Key stored in the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable.
*   **Secret Management**: The API key is managed via the `.gemini/.env` file, which is injected into the container at runtime. It should not be committed to version control.
*   **Network Security**: Communication occurs over HTTPS (TLS 1.2+).
*   **Input Sanitization**: The backend validates that uploaded files are valid image files and within size limits.
*   **Error Handling**: The integration client handles API errors gracefully, logging relevant details without exposing sensitive information.

## 4. Monitoring and Logging

*   **API Metrics**: Latency, error rates, and request volume for the Google Gemini API client are monitored.
*   **Logging**: Logs record the fact that a request was made and whether it succeeded or failed. **Payload data (images and prompts) is not logged.**
*   **Alerting**: Alerts are configured for high error rates (>5%) or abnormal latency (>2s).

## 5. Incident Response

In case of a suspected compromise of the `GOOGLE_API_KEY`:
1.  Immediately revoke the key in the Google Cloud Console.
2.  Generate a new key.
3.  Update the `.gemini/.env` file with the new key.
4.  Restart the GemFlash application container.
5.  Review Google Cloud audit logs for any unauthorized activity.
