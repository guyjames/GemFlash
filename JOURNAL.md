I have updated the backend to handle image generation and editing using the Google Gemini API.

The application is now feature-complete according to the requirements in `GOALS.md`.

Here is a summary of what I've done:

*   Set up the project structure with a React frontend and a Python backend.
*   Created a `Dockerfile` to containerize the application.
*   Automated the creation of the `favicon.ico`.
*   Implemented the frontend with a UI for image generation and editing.
*   Implemented the backend with an API that uses the Google Gemini API to generate and edit images.
*   Updated all the documentation to reflect the final state of the project.

The user can now build and run the application using `docker-compose`.

## Recent Updates - UI Improvements and Bug Fixes

### Compose Tab Enhancements (Latest Session)

**Issues Identified and Resolved:**

1. **Missing Remove Functionality in "Select Images for Composition"**
   - **Problem**: No way to remove images from the composition selection
   - **Solution**: Added `removeComposeImage` function and red X button UI
   - **Implementation**: 
     - Created function to filter out images by ID from both `composeImages` state and `selectedForCompose` set
     - Added red X button with destructive variant in top-right corner of each image
     - Used event.stopPropagation() to prevent conflicts with image selection

2. **Non-Functional Edit Button in "Composed Images"**
   - **Problem**: Edit button in composed images section was not working due to incorrect function implementation
   - **Root Cause**: `sendToEditTab` function was calling `setEditFile()` which doesn't exist, should be `setEditImage()`
   - **Solution**: Fixed function to properly transfer images to Edit tab
   - **Implementation**:
     - Corrected state setters to use `setEditImage()` and `setEditModelImages()`
     - Added proper blob-to-File conversion for React state compatibility
     - Implemented tab switching to Edit tab after image transfer
     - Added image to Available Images list with proper metadata

3. **Performance Issue on Edit Tab**
   - **Problem**: Edit tab was slow to load and URL input field was populated with base64 data
   - **Root Cause**: `sendToEditTab` was setting `setEditImageUrl(image.src)` where image.src contained base64 data
   - **Solution**: Changed to `setEditImageUrl("")` to clear URL field when transferring composed images
   - **Result**: Significantly improved Edit tab performance and clean UI

### Technical Implementation Details

**Functions Added/Modified:**
```javascript
// New remove function for compose images
const removeComposeImage = (imageId) => {
  setComposeImages(prev => prev.filter(img => img.id !== imageId))
  setSelectedForCompose(prev => {
    const newSet = new Set(prev)
    newSet.delete(imageId)
    return newSet
  })
}

// Fixed edit transfer function
const sendToEditTab = async (image) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(image.src)
    const blob = await response.blob()
    const file = new File([blob], `composed-image-${image.id}.png`, { type: 'image/png' })
    
    const newModelImage = {
      id: Date.now() + Math.random(),
      src: image.src,
      prompt: image.prompt || 'Composed image',
      type: 'transferred'
    }
    
    setEditImage(file)
    setEditImageUrl("") // Performance fix: clear URL field
    setEditModelImages(prev => [newModelImage, ...prev])
    setSelectedImageForEdit(newModelImage)
    setActiveTab('edit')
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error sending image to edit tab:', error)
  }
}
```

**UI Enhancements:**
- Added red X removal buttons with consistent styling across tabs
- Improved visual feedback with destructive button variants
- Enhanced user workflow between Compose and Edit tabs
- Optimized performance by preventing base64 data population in URL fields

### Development Process Notes

**Challenges Encountered:**
1. **Container Build Issues**: Encountered duplicate code in App.jsx causing build failures
2. **State Management**: Required careful handling of React state updates and Set objects
3. **File Conversion**: Needed proper blob-to-File conversion for React compatibility
4. **Performance Optimization**: Identified and resolved base64 data causing UI slowness

**Resolution Methods:**
1. Used git restore to clean up corrupted files
2. Careful code review and testing of state management functions
3. Proper async/await handling for file operations
4. Performance profiling to identify base64 data issue

**Testing Verification:**
- ✅ Remove functionality works in Compose tab
- ✅ Edit button transfers images to Edit tab correctly
- ✅ Tab switching functions properly
- ✅ Edit tab performance significantly improved
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved

The application now provides a complete and optimized user experience across all tabs with proper image management workflows.

### Loading Animations for Background Processes

**Issue:** The application did not provide any visual feedback to the user when background processes (image generation, editing, and composition) were running. This could lead to confusion and a poor user experience.

**Solution:** Implemented themed loading overlays for each of the "Generate", "Edit", and "Compose" tabs. These overlays are displayed when a background process starts and are hidden when the process completes.

**Implementation Details:**

*   **Created `CreativeProcessingOverlays.jsx`:** A new component file was created in `frontend/src/components/` to house the three new overlay components:
    *   `PaintBrushOverlay`: For the "Generate" tab.
    *   `CameraCaptureOverlay`: For the "Edit" tab.
    *   `MergeImagesOverlay`: For the "Compose" tab.
*   **State Management:** Added new state variables (`isGenerating`, `isEditing`, `isComposing`) to `App.jsx` to control the visibility of the overlays.
*   **Updated Handler Functions:** Modified `handleGenerateImage`, `handleEditImage`, and `handleComposeImages` in `App.jsx` to set the corresponding loading state to `true` at the beginning of the process and `false` at the end.
*   **CSS Fix:** Fixed a CSS issue in `frontend/src/index.css` where an `@import` statement was not at the top of the file, which was causing the build to fail.

**Result:** The application now provides clear visual feedback to the user during background processing, improving the user experience and making the application feel more responsive.
