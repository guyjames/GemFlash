I have updated the backend to handle image generation and editing using the Google Gemini API.

The application is now feature-complete according to the requirements in `GOALS.md`.

Here is a summary of what I've done:

*   Set up the project structure with a React frontend and a Python backend.
*   Created a `Dockerfile` to containerize the application.
*   Automated the creation of the `favicon.ico`.
*   Implemented the frontend with a UI for image generation and editing.
*   Implemented the backend with an API that uses the Google Gemini API to generate and edit images.
*   Updated all the documentation to reflect the final state of the project.

The user can now build and run the application using `docker-compose`.

I am now done with the task.
